# CareConnect ðŸ©º

CareConnect is a full-stack web application designed to connect patients with doctors, allowing for easy online appointment scheduling and management. It features a role-based system for patients, doctors, and administrators, built with a modern tech stack.

## Features

* **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate dashboards and permissions for **Patients**, **Doctors**, and **Admins**.
* **Secure Authentication**: End-to-end authentication using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) and **Spring Security**.
* **Patient Dashboard**: View, book, cancel, and reschedule appointments.
* **Doctor Dashboard**: View and manage daily/weekly appointment schedules.
* **Admin Dashboard**: Register new doctors, manage existing doctors, and view all users.
* **Dynamic Availability**: Doctors can have unique weekly schedules, and the system generates available timeslots in real-time.
* **Containerized Environment**: The entire application stack (Frontend, Backend, Database) runs in Docker containers orchestrated by **Docker Compose**.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Maven
* **Frontend**: React, Vite, Axios, React Router
* **Database**: MySQL
* **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose
